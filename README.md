**Dataset Analysis: ** <br>

The dataset used in this thesis comprises a collection of
images representing different plant species and their associated
diseases. The dataset is divided into four main categories:
corn, potato, rice, and wheat. Each category consists of specific
disease classes and a healthy class for comparison. The total
number of classes in the dataset is 14, with a combined total
of 13,024 images.<br>

A. Plant Overview<br>
1) Corn Plant Species: The corn category contains images
depicting diseases such as Common Rust, Gray Leaf Spots, and
Northern Leaf Blight, along with a class representing healthy
corn plants. The dataset includes a total of 3,852 images, with
Common Rust has 1,192 images, Gray Leaf Spot having
513 images, Northern Leaf Blight has 985 images, and
the Healthy class has 1,162 images. These images were
obtained from the widely-used PlantVillage dataset.<br>

2) Potato Plant Species: The potato category comprises
images related to Early Blight, Late Blight, and healthy potato
plants. A total of 2,152 images are included in this category,
with 1,000 images each for Early Blight and Late Blight, and
152 images representing the Healthy class. The images in this
category were collected from the PlantVillage dataset.<br>


3) Rice Plant Species: The rice category includes images
representing diseases like Brown Spot, Leaf Blast, and Neck
Blast, along with a Healthy class. The dataset consists of 4,078
images, with 613 images for Brown Spot, 977 images for Leaf
Blast, 1,000 for Neck Blast, and 1,488 for the Healthy class.
The images in this category were sourced from the ”DhanShomadhan” dataset [4] and the ”Rice Leafs” dataset from
Kaggle.<br>


5) Wheat Plant Species: The wheat category contains<br>
images related to diseases such as Brown Rust, Yellow Rust,
and healthy wheat plants. It consists of 2,942 images, with
902 images for Brown Rust, 924 images for Yellow Rust, and
1,116 images representing the Healthy class. The origin of the
wheat images used in this dataset was Kaggle.<br>
B. Data Distribution<br>
I can calculate the distribution of images in each class
to understand the relative representation of different plant diseases and the healthy class. <br>
Total images: 2942 images
